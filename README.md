# Job Application Form
My first website was a Job Application Form to gather information about potential candidates :clipboard:

## Overview
This was my first project! ðŸ¥³<br></br>
I build a Job Application Form in which candidates are asked about their personal details regarding a job application. The page features several input fields for the user to provide information, like name and age, as well as multiple-choice questions regarding what strikes them most about the company.<br></br>
My first page allowed me to grasp the essential concepts about **HTML forms**, like input validation, `POST` and `GET` methods and HTML5 constraint validation. Also, I learned about the box model, classes and some basic CSS properties like `position`, `display`, and `box-sizing`.<br></br>
At first, no JavaScript was used for this project because I hadn't studied it yet. However, I decided to add some events and further `Regex` input validation with JavaScript later on. jQuery was partly used, too. <br></br>
Users are asked to create a password because they are allegedly creating an account to the job poster's portal.

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript E6 (**later implemented**)
- jQuery (**later implemented**)

## BEHAVIOUR
- Some HTML5 input types have built-in validation parameters, which is known as HTML constraint validation.
- Some inputs are marked as required and must be filled to submit the form.
- Candidates are asked to upload their resume.
- The form features some required multiple-choice questions and a text area to provide additional information.
- Naturally, the form is submitted nowhere.

## REGEX
Regular expressions (`regex`) are used to validate user input in passwords fields.<br></br>
A triple check is performed by a `for` `loop` to see if the password has at least one number, one uppercase and one lowercase.<br></br>
The second password field (repeat password) checks if passwords in both inputs match.<br></br>
